Created a CNN model to classify plant diseases from images using TensorFlow and Keras with over 38 distinct 
disease categories. 

Preprocessed image datasets with data augmentation and executed Conv2D and MaxPooling layers with 94% 
accuracy. 

Integrated Streamlit for user-friendly display of real-time classification results, enhancing accessibility and 
visualization of predictions.
